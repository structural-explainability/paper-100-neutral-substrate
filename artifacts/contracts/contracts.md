### Title

```
The Ontological Neutrality Theorem:\\
Why Neutral Ontological Substrates Must Be \\
Pre-Causal and Pre-Normative
```

### Abstract

```
Modern data systems must support accountability
  across persistent legal, political, and analytic disagreement.
  This requirement imposes strict constraints
  on the design of any ontology intended to function as a shared substrate.
  We establish an impossibility result for ontological neutrality:
  neutrality, understood as interpretive non-commitment and stability
  under incompatible extensions, is incompatible with the inclusion of
  causal or normative commitments at the foundational layer.
  Any ontology that asserts causal or deontic conclusions
  as ontological facts cannot serve as a neutral substrate across divergent
  frameworks without revision or contradiction.
  It follows that neutral ontological substrates
  must be pre-causal and pre-normative,
  representing entities, together with identity and persistence conditions,
  while externalizing interpretation, evaluation, and explanation.
  This paper does not propose a specific ontology or protocol;
  rather, it establishes the necessary design constraints
  for any system intended to maintain a shared,
  stable representation of reality across conflicting interpretive frameworks.

\section*{Proof Contract and Direction of Dependence}
\label{sec:proof-contract}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Proof Contract and Direction of Dependence}

This paper establishes substrate-layer constraints.
Claims are structural: not empirical, causal, or normative.


\subsection*{Paper-Level Constraints}


\REQ{THEOREM}{All formal and informal arguments in this paper
  MUST discharge the Ontological Neutrality Theorem and no other claim.}
\WHY{THEOREM}{Restricting the proof target prevents scope creep
  into ontology design, governance, or application domains.}

\REQ{P0-GOAL}{This paper MUST establish necessary and sufficient
  substrate-layer conditions for ontological neutrality,
  independent of any specific domain ontology, protocol, or implementation.}
\WHY{P0-GOAL}{This paper serves as a proof paper:
  its role is to establish admissibility constraints
  without committing to any particular instantiation.}

\REQ{PROOF}{All claims MUST follow from explicit definitions,
  stated assumptions, and logical inference.
  No causal, empirical, evaluative, or normative premises
  are admitted unless explicitly marked as OBS.}
\WHY{PROOF}{Substrate claims must remain valid
  across incompatible causal theories, value systems, and
  policy interpretations.
  Embedding such commitments violates neutrality
  and precludes representational admissibility.}

\OBS{P0-READING}{This paper is intended to be reviewed independently.
  No claims rely on external definitions beyond generic notions of
  ontology, identity, and interpretation.}


\subsection*{Foundational Requirements}


\REQ{WELL-FORMED}{All formal objects introduced in this paper MUST be
  admissible and well-formed with respect to the assumed ontology
  and substrate constraints.}
\WHY{WELL-FORMED}{Well-formedness ensures that definitions,
  constructions, and inferences do not silently violate
  neutrality, identity, or required dependence ordering.}

\REQ{PC}{The substrate MUST be pre-causal.}
\WHY{PC}{Causal primitives impose directional explanatory commitments and
  constrain admissible interpretations.}

\REQ{NEUTRAL}{The substrate MUST not encode normative, evaluative, or policy judgments.}
\WHY{NEUTRAL}{Normative commitments are actor-relative and domain-specific;
  encoding them collapses plural frames into a privileged one.}

\REQ{ID-INVAR}{Entity existence and identity conditions
  MUST be invariant across admissible frameworks within the domain.}
\WHY{ID-INVAR}{Neutrality presupposes shared referents.
  Domains where identity itself is contested do not admit neutral substrates
  until identity is resolved at a prior stage.}

\REQ{ID}{Entity identity MUST be established prior to explanation or interpretation.}
\WHY{ID}{Explanation presupposes stable referents; without
  identity criteria, accountability relations cannot be formed or compared.}

\REQ{MINIMAL}{The substrate MUST include only entities and relations
  necessary for accountability analysis, and no more.}
\WHY{MINIMAL}{Foundational excess introduces hidden assumptions and
  increases domain contamination risk.}

\REQ{SCOPE-GUARD}{This paper MUST NOT argue that all ontologies should be neutral,
  only that neutral substrates have categorical constraints.}
\WHY{SCOPE-GUARD}{Many ontologies are legitimately causal or normative;
  neutrality is a role-relative requirement, not a universal virtue.}


\subsection*{Direction of Dependence}


\REQ{DEP}{The direction of dependence MUST be:
  \emph{Identity precedes explanation; explanation precedes interpretation}.}
\WHY{DEP}{Reversing this order pushes interpretive or causal assumptions
  into identity, undermining neutrality and comparability.}


\subsection*{Explicit Non-Goals}


\OBS{NG}{This paper does NOT establish causal explanations of civic outcomes.}
\OBS{NG}{This paper does NOT evaluate legitimacy, legality, or
  morality of any actor, action, or institution.}
\OBS{NG}{This paper does NOT prescribe policy,
  governance mechanisms, or analytic conclusions.}


\subsection*{Obligations of Subsequent Sections}


Each subsequent section exists only to discharge one or more stated REQ items.
Material that does not advance a stated REQ is out of scope.

\noindent\textbf{End of Proof Contract.}


\subsection*{Annotation Conventions}


Annotations (\texttt{REQ}, \texttt{WHY}, \texttt{OBS}) appear in
Section~\ref{sec:requirements},
Section~\ref{sec:impossibility}, and
Section~\ref{sec:implications}
to document constraints and their discharge.
Framing sections
(e.g., Front Matter, Introduction, Related Work, Conclusion)
restate or contextualize claims established elsewhere
and neither require nor include annotations.
